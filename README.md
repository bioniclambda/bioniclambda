### Hi

I make bad projects for fun and I have no idea what I'm doing basically ever.


[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=bioniclambda)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
This is a cool thing I found

Acool project I'm working on is [Blush](https://github.com/bioniclambda/blush)

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working on **blush as well as some personal projects I might open source**
- I’m currently learning **C and ASM**
- I’m looking to collaborate on **I'm bad at code**
- I’m looking for help with **nothin I'm an amazing coder**
- Ask me about ... *cricket noises*
- How to reach me: **Preferable Discord at `bioniclambda#2556` but my email is `bioniclambda@gmail.com`**
- Fun fact: **I'm not a human**
- Bonus fun fact: My only friends are on GitHub
